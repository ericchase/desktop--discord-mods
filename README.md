Find `index.js` under:

- `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Discord\app-[LATEST_VERSION]\modules\discord_voice-1\discord_voice`
- Append `mod.js` code to end of `index.js` code.
- Refresh discord client.

Note: If `index.js` is missing, discord may have failed to update properly. Try uninstalling and installing Discord again.
